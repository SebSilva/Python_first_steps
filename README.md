# Python_first_steps (assignment for the the course Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis from http://spatialthoughts.com)
# My first script: a very basic search engine that lets you search the Reliefweb site and look for training, jobs or reports (max. 10 results). 
# Then you can export these results into a CSV file, created within a new folder called Reliefweb.
# Note: The most clever part of the script is a contribution from Ujaval,
# as my initial script was a bit messy
